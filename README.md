# Capistrano Modules

This repository contains "modules" that can be used with Capistrano. Each module has its own README with further instructions on how to use it.

## Contributing

Pull requests containing fixes, modifications, and documentation is highly encouraged. So are new modules.

I'd like to keep these modules related to system administration, though, so please keep new modules related to that field.
