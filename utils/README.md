# Utils

This module contains generic ruby code to help with other modules.

The "uptime" task is a basic task that I use when testing new features. Feel free to do the same or just delete it.

## Installation and Configuration

Add the following to your `Capfile`:

```ruby
require_releative 'modules/utils/lib/helpers'
```
